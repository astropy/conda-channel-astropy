#   # Version should match the version on PyPI. Versions that could be
#   # interpereted as numbers (e.g. 0.1) should be enclosed in quotes.
#   version: 0.3.2

#   # conda builds disable downloading, but astropy-helpers is typically
#   # configured to try to autoupdate during install of affiliated
#   # packages. Set to true if the package uses astropy-helpers and
#   # auto-update and the --offline flag will be passed to setup.py.
#   setup_options: '--offline'   # Defaults to false if omitted.

#   # If the package contains compiled extensions that link to numpy this
#   # must be set to true to ensure the package is built properly.
#   # If in doubt, set it to true...though it should *always* be false
#   # for a pure python package.
#   numpy_compiled_extensions: false   # Defaults to false if omitted.

#   # Some packages can only be built for specific versions of python but
#   # setup.py often does not contain those restrictions (and conda skeleton
#   # ignores it if present), so list restrictions on python version here.

#   # python: '>2.6|>=3.4'  # if omitted, no restriction on python builds.
